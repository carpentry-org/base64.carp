# base64.carp

A base64 library for Carp from scratch.

Currently this library only exposes two functions, `encode` and `decode`. Both
take a string and return a string. Together, they are idempotent. If you want,
you can check out the documentation [online](https://veitheller.de/base64/),
but itâ€™s very sparse.

Have fun!
